## Installation ðŸ”§

### Server

Install python dependencies

```
$ pip install -r server/requirements.txt
```

Setup the .env file for Database & Google YouTube API functionality
NOTE: For the YouTube API, First you will need to set up a project in your Google Console and then get API Keys

Start the Django server

```
$ python3 manage.py runserver
```

## ðŸ’¥ Sending Requests

Use Postman to send GET requests to the server at specific URLs:
```
# http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/fetchvids - GET request
# http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/getdata - GET request
```
 - The first URL uses the YouTube API to fetch video data, and then stores it in the database
 - The second URL queries the database based on the parameters passed in the request to return a paginated response of the result of the request sent to the first URL
 - If the results for a query are not in the database, a request is made using the YouTube API and the results are fetched at that moment (Dynamic Searching)
 - Celery & Redis Have been used to create and run the task of fetching video data from the YouTube API every 45 seconds in the background
